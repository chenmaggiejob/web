    作詞：Kristen Anderson-Lopez 作曲：Robert Lopez
    The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
    Not a footprint to be seen
    A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I’m the queen
    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
    Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried

    Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
    Be the good girl you always have to be
    Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
    Well now they know

    Let it go, let it go
    Can’t hold it back anymore
    Let it go, let it go
    Turn away and slam the door
    I don’t care what they’re going to say
    Let the storm rage on
    The cold never bothered me anyway.

    It’s funny how some distance
    Makes everything seems small
    And the fears that once controlled me
    Can’t get to me at all

    It’s time to see what I can do
    To test the limits and break through
    No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
    I’m free

    Let it go, let it go
    I am one with the wind and sky
    Let it go, let it go,
    You’ll never see me cry
    Here I stand and Here I’ll stay
    Let the storm rage on…

    My power flurries through the air into the ground
    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
    I’m never going back
    The past is in the past

    Let it go, let it go
    And I’ll rise like the break of dawn
    Let it go, let it go
    That perfect girl is gone
    Here I stand in the light of day
    Let the storm rage on
    The cold never bothered me anyway
